<h1>Beef and Lentil Stew</h1>
    <img src="../images/beefstew.jpeg" height="200" width="auto">

<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow moist heat method. This makes it popular in low-cost cooking. Cuts having a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry.</p>
    <p>Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing, or by using a roux or beurre mani√©, a dough consisting of equal parts of fat and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pound flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>4 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup dry lentils</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried rosemary</li>
        <li>11 ounces baby potatoes with skin</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour flour into a shallow bowl and dust steak with flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat and sear beef on all sides until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, onion, celery, and garlic to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add more oil if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes with juice, lentils, beef broth, rosemary, and browned beef pieces to the skillet and stir well. Reduce heat, cover pot halfway with a lid, and simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes to the skillet. Simmer until lentils and potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
