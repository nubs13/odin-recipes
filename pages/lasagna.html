<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages and have traditionally 
        been ascribed to the city of Naples. The first recorded recipe was set 
        down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery)</p>
    <p>The traditional lasagne of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, are layered 
        with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta 
        and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce. 
        Lasagne al forno, layered with a thicker ragù and Béchamel sauce, and 
        corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are 
        traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. In 
        other regions, lasagne can be made with various combinations of ricotta 
        or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or 
        chicken), and vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), 
        and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and o
        regano. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked (al forno).</p>
